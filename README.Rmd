## Training

We recommend using the [mlverse/docker](https://github.com/mlverse/docker) image which you can retrieve and run as follows:

```{bash}
docker pull mlverse/mlverse-base:version-0.2.0
docker run --gpus all -p 8787:8787 -d mlverse/mlverse-base:version-0.2.0
```

You can then connect to RStudio Server under port https://public-address:8787, followed by installing and runninng AlexNet:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("r-tensorflow/alexnet")

alexnet_train::alexnet_train()
```
